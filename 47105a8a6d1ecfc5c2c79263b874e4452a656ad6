Then again could just include the system groups in your config file I guess - but the way config.read works should just append as one would expect. Not sure why you want to stop?\n\n(And only parse confdir files if that is given, yeah.)",

I can quite easily change it to work like you said ( and like clush.conf ....yes), as it is supported by config.read(), but in that case, there won\u0027t be a way to disable a group source. If some system group sources are only available by root, it won\u0027t work for the user. That was my concern when I wrote this.",

      "message": "Right, after thinking more about this, I agree it would be better. One behavior however needs to be changed so that is will work smoothly : if we want to put the same config files in user dir than the system ones (eg. with pip), an user should be able to override a source name, which is not possible today (would raise \"source name already exists\"). I need to change it so that when loading 2 times the same sources, it will just override it. This is something to consider.",

      "message": "Ok, I made a change, tested it a bit, and as groups.conf is loaded using config.read(filenames), options are smoothly inherited from system config if not present, and overrided if needed. So by default, it doesn\u0027t even load system groups.conf.d or groups.d directory, only local ones. But that can be changed or documented as wanted. But the tough thing about groups.conf.d/*.conf and groups.d/*.yaml files is that they are not loaded this way, so duplicates lead to ValueError GroupSource name collision (as I said previously). BUT --- as by default, we have all these dot-files using .example (thx Aurelien ;-), we could stay this way and local user won\u0027t be able to override system source name - it would require a source name changes if user wants to enable a common source. Any thoughts?\n\nP.S. there is no conflict problem for the \"local\" source using local.cfg as it is defined directly in groups.conf AND it is using CFGDIR so only the local local.cfg is used.",
