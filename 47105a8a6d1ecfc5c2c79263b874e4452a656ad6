      "message": "Couldn\u0027t we just add new groups and overwrite existing group if we just load files in the opposite order? e.g. system then .local then .config then $XDG\n\nIt\u0027s a shame to lose system groups just because you add a new one... Then again could just include the system groups in your config file I guess - but the way config.read works should just append as one would expect. Not sure why you want to stop?\n\n(And only parse confdir files if that is given, yeah.)",

I can quite easily change it to work like you said ( and like clush.conf ....yes), as it is supported by config.read(), but in that case, there won\u0027t be a way to disable a group source. If some system group sources are only available by root, it won\u0027t work for the user. That was my concern when I wrote this.",
