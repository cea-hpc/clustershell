Have you seen my comment with patch set 1?\nSo I have two choices here:\n1) keep inspect, but as you suggest (good idea) add a comment for future DeprecationWarning. Or why not adding DeprecationWarning right now? It shouldn\u0027t be used yet anyway, well, I think...\n2) Remove inspect and let\u0027s broken codes fail if whenever they exist..",
