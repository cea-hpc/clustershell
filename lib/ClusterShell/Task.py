class Task(object):
    """
    The Task class defines an essential ClusterShell object which aims to
    execute commands in parallel and easily get their results.

    More precisely, a Task object manages a coordinated (ie. with respect of
    its current parameters) collection of independent parallel Worker objects.
    See ClusterShell.Worker.Worker for further details on ClusterShell Workers.

    Always bound to a specific thread, a Task object acts like a "thread
    singleton". So most of the time, and even more for single-threaded
    applications, you can get the current task object with the following
    top-level Task module function:

        >>> task = task_self()

    However, if you want to create a task in a new thread, use:

        >>> task = Task()

    To create or get the instance of the task associated with the thread
    object thr (threading.Thread):

        >>> task = Task(thread=thr)

    To submit a command to execute locally within task, use:

        >>> task.shell("/bin/hostname")

    To submit a command to execute to some distant nodes in parallel, use:

        >>> task.shell("/bin/hostname", nodes="tiger[1-20]")

    The previous examples submit commands to execute but do not allow result
    interaction during their execution. For your program to interact during
    command execution, it has to define event handlers that will listen for
    local or remote events. These handlers are based on the EventHandler
    class, defined in ClusterShell.Event. The following example shows how to
    submit a command on a cluster with a registered event handler:

        >>> task.shell("uname -r", nodes="node[1-9]", handler=MyEventHandler())

    Run task in its associated thread (will block only if the calling thread is
    the task associated thread):

        >>> task.resume()
    or:

        >>> task.run()

    You can also pass arguments to task.run() to schedule a command exactly
    like in task.shell(), and run it:

        >>> task.run("hostname", nodes="tiger[1-20]", handler=MyEventHandler())

    A common need is to set a maximum delay for command execution, especially
    when the command time is not known. Doing this with ClusterShell Task is
    very straighforward. To limit the execution time on each node, use the
    timeout parameter of shell() or run() methods to set a delay in seconds,
    like:

        >>> task.run("check_network.sh", nodes="tiger[1-20]", timeout=30)

    You can then either use Task's iter_keys_timeout() method after execution
    to see on what nodes the command has timed out, or listen for ev_close()
    events in your event handler and check the timedout boolean.

    To get command result, you can either use Task's iter_buffers() method for
    standard output, iter_errors() for standard error after command execution
    (common output contents are automatically gathered), or you can listen for
    ev_read() events in your event handler and get live command output.

    To get command return codes, you can either use Task's iter_retcodes(),
    node_retcode() and max_retcode() methods after command execution, or
    listen for ev_hup() events in your event handler.

        The following example enables debug messages:
            >>> task.set_info('debug', True)

        Task info_keys are:
          - "debug": Boolean value indicating whether to enable library
            debugging messages (default: False).
          - "print_debug": Debug messages processing function. This
            function takes 2 arguments: the task instance and the
            message string (default: an internal function doing standard
            print).
          - "fanout": Max number of registered clients in Engine at a
            time (default: 64).
          - "grooming_delay": Message maximum end-to-end delay requirement
            used for traffic grooming, in seconds as float (default: 0.5).
          - "connect_timeout": Time in seconds to wait for connecting to
            remote host before aborting (default: 10).
          - "command_timeout": Time in seconds to wait for a command to
            complete before aborting (default: 0, which means
            unlimited).
          - "tree_default:<key>": In tree mode, overrides the key <key>
            in Defaults (settings normally set in defaults.conf)

        Threading considerations
        ========================
          Unlike set_default(), the underlying info dictionary is only
          modified from the task's thread. So calling set_info() from
          another thread leads to queueing the request for late apply
          (at run time) using the task dispatch port. When received,
          the request wakes up the engine when the task is running and
          the info dictionary is then updated.

    def shell(self, command, **kwargs):

        Schedule a shell command for local or distant parallel execution. This
        essential method creates a local or remote Worker (depending on the
        presence of the nodes parameter) and immediately schedules it for
        execution in task's runloop. So, if the task is already running
        (ie. called from an event handler), the command is started immediately,
        assuming current execution constraints are met (eg. fanout value). If
        the task is not running, the command is not started but scheduled for
        late execution. See resume() to start task runloop.

        The following optional parameters are passed to the underlying local
        or remote Worker constructor:
          - handler: EventHandler instance to notify (on event) -- default is
            no handler (None)
          - timeout: command timeout delay expressed in second using a floating
            point value -- default is unlimited (None)
          - autoclose: if set to True, the underlying Worker is automatically
            aborted as soon as all other non-autoclosing task objects (workers,
            ports, timers) have finished -- default is False
          - stderr: separate stdout/stderr if set to True -- default is False.
          - stdin: enable stdin if set to True or prevent its use otherwise --
            default is True.

        Local usage::
            task.shell(command [, key=key] [, handler=handler]
                  [, timeout=secs] [, autoclose=enable_autoclose]
                  [, stderr=enable_stderr][, stdin=enable_stdin]))

                  [, stderr=enable_stderr][, stdin=enable_stdin]))
