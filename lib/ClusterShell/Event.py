ClusterShell Event handling.

This module contains the base class **EventHandler** which defines a simple
interface through methods to handle events coming from ClusterShell I/O Engine
clients. Events are generated by Worker, EngineTimer or EnginePort objects.

    Derived class should implement any of the following methods to listen for
    Worker, EngineTimer or EnginePort selected events. If not implemented,
    the default behavior is to do nothing.
