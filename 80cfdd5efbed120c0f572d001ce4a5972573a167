      "message": "Ok here I wasn\u0027t clear enough about why I added this class. I fully agree it sounds weird. Well, the story is that I did some clush benchmark, and noticed that ev_read() is ultra critical here. I lost several seconds of execution just by adding a \"if runtimer_clean()\" in ev_read (on 1 million ev_read triggered). So my goal here is absolutely not to reduce the performance of DirectOutputHandler. That\u0027s why I copied it for another one... I know it\u0027s a bit overkill but performance first, right?",
