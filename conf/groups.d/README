groups.d/README

Default directory for YAML node group sources definition files.
ClusterShell scans the directory set by the autodir variable, defined
in /etc/clustershell/groups.conf, loading all files of the form *.yaml.

These files are automatically parsed by ClusterShell to avoid the need
of external upcalls for flat files-based group sources.

Each file may contain one or several group sources definitions.
Format of each YAML file is as follow:

source1:
    group1: 'nodeset1'
    group2: 'nodeset2'

source2:
    group3: 'nodeset3'
    group4: 'nodeset4'
    ...

Please take a look at *.yaml.example files for more examples.
