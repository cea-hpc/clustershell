# NOTE: This is a simple group configuration example file, not a
#       default config file. Please edit it to fit your own needs.

[Main]

# Default group source
default: local

# Group source config directory list (space separated, use quotes if needed).
# Examples are provided. Copy them from *.conf.example to *.conf to enable.
#
# $CFGDIR is replaced by the highest priority config directory found.
# Default confdir value enables both system-wide and user configuration.
confdir: /etc/clustershell/groups.conf.d $CFGDIR/groups.conf.d

# New in 1.7, autodir defines a directory list (space separated, use quotes if
# needed) where group data files will be auto-loaded.
# Only *.yaml file are loaded. Copy *.yaml.example files to enable.
# Group data files avoid the need of external calls for static config files.
#
# $CFGDIR is replaced by the highest priority config directory found.
# Default autodir value enables both system-wide and user configuration.
autodir: /etc/clustershell/groups.d $CFGDIR/groups.d

# Sections below also define group sources.
#
# NOTE: /etc/clustershell/groups is deprecated since version 1.7, thus if it
#       doesn't exist, the "local.cfg" file from autodir will be used.
#
# See the documentation for $CFGDIR, $SOURCE, $GROUP and $NODE upcall special
# variables. Please remember that they are substituted before the shell command
# is effectively executed.
