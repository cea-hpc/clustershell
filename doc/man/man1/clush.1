.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBclush\fP is a program for executing commands in parallel on a cluster and for
gathering their results. \fBclush\fP executes commands interactively or can be
used within shell scripts and other applications.  It is a partial front\-end
to the ClusterShell library that ensures a light, unified and robust parallel
command execution framework. Thus, it allows traditional shell scripts to
benefit from some of the library features. \fBclush\fP currently makes use of
the Ssh worker of ClusterShell, by default, that only requires \fBssh\fP(1)
(OpenSSH SSH client).
.SH INVOCATION
.sp
\fBclush\fP can be started non\-interactively to run a shell \fIcommand\fP, or can
be invoked as an interactive shell. To start a \fBclush\fP interactive session,
invoke the \fBclush\fP command without providing \fIcommand\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Non\-interactive mode
When \fBclush\fP is started non\-interactively, the \fIcommand\fP is executed on
the specified remote hosts in parallel. If option \fB\-b\fP or \fB\-\-dshbak\fP
is specified, \fBclush\fP waits for command completion and then displays
gathered output results.
.sp
The \fB\-w\fP option allows you to specify remote hosts by using ClusterShell
NodeSet syntax, including the node groups \fB@group\fP special syntax and the
\fBExtended Patterns\fP syntax to benefits from NodeSet basic arithmetics
(like \fB@Agroup\e&@Bgroup\fP). See EXTENDED PATTERNS in \fBnodeset\fP(1) and
also \fBgroups.conf\fP(5) for more information.
.sp
Unless option \fB\-\-nostdin\fP is specified, \fBclush\fP detects when its
standard input is connected to a terminal (as determined by \fBisatty\fP(3)).
If actually connected to a terminal, \fBclush\fP listens to standard input
when commands are running, waiting for an \fIEnter\fP key press. Doing so will
display the status of current nodes.  If standard input is not connected
to a terminal, and unless option \fB\-\-nostdin\fP is specified, \fBclush\fP
binds the standard input of the remote commands to its own standard input,
allowing scripting methods like:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.nf
# echo foo | clush \-w node[40\-42] \-b cat
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
node[40\-42]
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
foo
.fi

.TP
.B Interactive session
If a \fIcommand\fP is not specified, and its standard input is connected to a
terminal, \fBclush\fP runs interactively. In this mode, \fBclush\fP uses the GNU
\fBreadline\fP library to read command lines. Readline provides commands for
searching through the command history for lines containing a specified
string. For instance, type Control\-R to search in the history for the next
entry matching the search string typed so far.  \fBclush\fP also recognizes
special single\-character prefixes that allows the user to see and modify
the current nodeset (the nodes where the commands are executed).
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B Single\-character interactive commands are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B clush> ?
show current nodeset
.TP
.B clush> =<NODESET>
set current nodeset
.TP
.B clush> +<NODESET>
add nodes to current nodeset
.TP
.B clush> \-<NODESET>
remove nodes from current nodeset
.TP
.B clush> !COMMAND
execute COMMAND on the local system
.TP
.B clush> =
toggle the output format (gathered or standard mode)

.sp
To leave an interactive session, type \fBquit\fP or Control\-D.
.TP
.B Local execution ( \fB\-\-worker=exec\fP or \fB\-R exec\fP )
Instead of running provided command on remote nodes, \fBclush\fP can use the
dedicated \fIexec\fP worker to launch the command \fIlocally\fP, for each node.
Some parameters could be used in the command line to make a different
command for each node. \fB%h\fP or \fB%host\fP will be replaced by node name and
\fB%r\fP or \fB%rank\fP by the remote rank [0\-N] (to get a literal % use %%)
.TP
.B File copying mode ( \fB\-\-copy\fP )
When \fBclush\fP is started with the \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-\-copy\fP option, it will
attempt to copy specified \fIfile\fP and/or \fIdir\fP to the provided target
cluster nodes.  If the \fB\-\-dest\fP option is specified, it will put the
copied files there.
.TP
.B Reverse file copying mode ( \fB\-\-rcopy\fP )
When \fBclush\fP is started with the \fB\-\-rcopy\fP option, it will attempt to
retrieve specified \fIfile\fP and/or \fIdir\fP from provided cluster nodes. If the
\fB\-\-dest\fP option is specified, it must be a directory path where the files
will be stored with their hostname appended. If the destination path is not
specified, it will take the first \fIfile\fP or \fIdir\fP basename directory as the
local destination.

For a short explanation of these options, see \fB\-h, \-\-help\fP\&.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
By default, an exit status of zero indicates success of the \fBclush\fP command
but gives no information about the remote commands exit status. However, when
the \fB\-S\fP option is specified, the exit status of \fBclush\fP is the largest
value of the remote commands return codes.
.sp
For failed remote commands whose exit status is non\-zero, and unless the
combination of options \fB\-qS\fP is specified, \fBclush\fP displays messages
similar to:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
