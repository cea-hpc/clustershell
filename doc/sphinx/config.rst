clush
-----

The configuration file */etc/clustershell/clush.conf* defines default values
for several *clush* tool parameters.

+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Key             | Value                                              |
+=================+====================================================+
| fanout          | Size of the sliding window of *ssh(1)* connectors. |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| connect_timeout | Timeout in seconds to allow a connection to        |
|                 | establish. This parameter is passed to *ssh(1)*.   |
|                 | If set to 0, no timeout occurs.                    |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| command_timeout | Timeout in seconds to allow a command to complete  |
|                 | since the connection has been established. This    |
|                 | parameter is passed to *ssh(1)*. In addition, the  |
|                 | ClusterShell library ensures that any commands     |
|                 | complete in less than (connect_timeout \+          |
|                 | command_timeout). If set to 0, no timeout occurs.  |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| color           | Whether  to  use  ANSI  colors  to  surround node  |
|                 | or nodeset prefix/header with escape sequences to  |
|                 | display them in color on the terminal. Valid       |
|                 | arguments are *never*, *always* or *auto* (which   |
|                 | use color if standard output/error refer to a      |
|                 | terminal).                                         |
|                 | Colors are set to ``[34m`` (blue foreground text)  |
|                 | for stdout and ``[31m`` (red foreground text) for  |
|                 | stderr, and cannot be modified.                    |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| fd_max          | Maximum  number  of  open  file descriptors        |
|                 | permitted per *clush* process (soft resource limit |
|                 | for open files). This limit can never exceed the   |
|                 | system (hard) limit. The *fd_max* (soft) and       |
|                 | system (hard) limits should be high enough to      |
|                 | run *clush*, although their values depend on       |
|                 | your fanout value.                                 |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| history_size    | Set the maximum number of history entries saved in |
|                 | the GNU readline history list. Negative values     |
|                 | imply unlimited history file size.                 |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| node_count      | Should *clush* display additional (node count)     |
|                 | information in buffer header? (yes/no)             |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| verbosity       | Set the verbosity level: 0 (quiet), 1 (default),   |
|                 | 2 (verbose) or more (debug).                       |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| ssh_user        | Set the *ssh(1)* user to use for remote connection |
|                 | (default is to not specify).                       |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| ssh_path        | Set the *ssh(1)* binary path to use for remote     |
|                 | connection (default is *ssh*).                     |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| ssh_options     | Set additional (raw) options to pass to the        |
|                 | underlying *ssh(1)* command.                       |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| scp_path        | Set the *scp(1)* binary path to use for remote     |
|                 | copy (default is *scp*).                           |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| scp_options     | Set additional options to pass to the underlying   |
|                 | *scp(1)* command. If not specified, *ssh_options*  |
|                 | are used instead.                                  |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| rsh_path        | Set the *rsh(1)* binary path to use for remote     |
|                 | connection (default is *rsh*). You could easily    |
|                 | use *mrsh* or *krsh* by simply changing this       |
|                 | value.                                             |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| rcp_path        | Same as *rsh_path* but for rcp command (default is |
|                 | *rcp*).                                            |
+-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| rsh_options     | Set additional options to pass to the underlying   |
|                 | rsh/rcp command.                                   |

.. _groups-config:

Node groups
-----------

The basics
^^^^^^^^^^

ClusterShell defines node group as a collection of nodes, see section
:ref:`nodeset-groups` for usage information. This section explains how to
configure group nodes.

The system-wide library configuration file */etc/clustershell/groups.conf*
defines how the ClusterShell library obtains node groups configuration, mainly
the way the library should access external node group **sources**. These
**sources** provide external calls to list groups, to get nodes contained in
specified group, etc. The following example is the content of a
*groups.conf* file where node groups are bound to the source named *genders*
by default::

    [Main]
    default: genders
    confdir: /etc/clustershell/groups.conf.d
    autodir: /etc/clustershell/groups.d

    [genders]
    map: nodeattr -n $GROUP
    all: nodeattr -n ALL
    list: nodeattr -l

    [slurm]
    map: sinfo -h -o "%N" -p $GROUP
    all: sinfo -h -o "%N"
    list: sinfo -h -o "%P"
    reverse: sinfo -h -N -o "%P" -n $NODE

This configuration file is parsed by Python's `ConfigParser`_:

* The first section whose name is *Main* accepts the following keywords:

  * *default* defines a **default node group source** by referencing a valid
    section header
  * *confdir* defines an optional list of directories where the ClusterShell
    library should look for .conf files which define group sources to use.
    Each file in these directories with the .conf suffix should contain one or
    more node group source sections as documented below.  These will be merged
    with the group sources defined in */etc/clustershell/groups.conf* to form
    the complete set of group sources to use. Duplicate group source sections
    are not allowed.  Configuration files that are not readable by the current
    user are ignored (except the one that defines the default group source).
  * *autodir* defines an optional list of directories where the ClusterShell
    library should look for **.yaml** files that define in-file group
    dictionaries. No need to call external commands for these files, they are
    parsed by the ClusterShell library itself. Multiple group source
    definitions in the same file is supported.

* Each following section (`genders`, `slurm`) defines a  group source. The
  map, all, list and reverse upcalls are explained below in
  :ref:`group-sources-upcalls`.

.. _group-multi-sources:

Multiple sources section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use a comma-separated list of source names in the section header if you want
to define multiple group sources with similar upcall commands. The special
variable `$SOURCE` is always replaced by the source name before command
execution (here `cluster`, `racks` and `cpu`), for example::

    [cluster,racks,cpu]
    map: get_nodes_from_source.sh $SOURCE $GROUP
    all: get_all_nodes_from_source.sh $SOURCE
    list: list_nodes_from_source.sh $SOURCE

is equivalent to::

    [cluster]
    map: get_nodes_from_source.sh cluster $GROUP
    all: get_all_nodes_from_source.sh cluster
    list: list_nodes_from_source.sh cluster

    [racks]
    map: get_nodes_from_source.sh racks $GROUP
    all: get_all_nodes_from_source.sh racks
    list: list_nodes_from_source.sh racks

    [cpu]
    map: get_nodes_from_source.sh cpu $GROUP
    all: get_all_nodes_from_source.sh cpu
    list: list_nodes_from_source.sh cpu

Please note that single flat files with several sections acting as different
group sources are supported through the *autodir* feature based on YAML files.
An example of such configuration is available at::

    /etc/clustershell/groups.d/cluster.yaml.example

Just rename it to ``cluster.yaml`` and be sure that *autodir* is set to enable
it.

Feel free to edit this file to fit your needs.

.. _group-sources-upcalls:

Group source upcalls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each node group source is defined by a section name (*source* name) and up to
four upcalls:

* **map**: External shell command used to resolve a group name into a node
  set, list of nodes or list of node sets (separated by space characters or by
  carriage returns). The variable *$GROUP* is replaced before executing the command.
* **all**: Optional external shell command that should return a node set, list
  of nodes or list of node sets of all nodes for this group source. If not
  specified, the library will try to resolve all nodes by using the **list**
  external command in the same group source followed by **map** for each available group.
* **list**: Optional external shell command that should return the list of all
  groups for this group source (separated by space characters or by carriage
  returns). If this upcall is not specified, ClusterShell won't be able to
  list any available groups (eg. with ``nodeset -l``), so it is highly
  recommended to set it.
* **reverse**: Optional external shell command used to find the group(s) of a
  single node. The variable *$NODE* is previously replaced. If this external
  call is not specified, the reverse operation is computed in memory by the
  library from the **list** and **map** external calls, if available. Also, if
  the number of nodes to reverse is greater than the number of available
  groups, the reverse external command is avoided automatically to reduce
  resolution time.

In addition to context-dependent *$GROUP* and *$NODE* variables, the variable
*$SOURCE* is always replaced by the source name before command execution.
Please see :ref:`group-multi-sources`.

Return code of external calls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each external command might return a non-zero return code when the operation
is not doable. But if the call return zero, for instance, for a non-existing
group, the user will not receive any error when trying to resolve such unknown
group. The desired behavior is up to the system administrator.
