Tools
=====

Three Python scripts using the ClusterShell library are provided with the
distribution:

* `cluset` or `nodeset`, both are the same tool to manage cluster node sets and groups,
* `clush`, a powerful parallel command execution tool with output gathering,
* `clubak`, a tool to gather and display results from clush/pdsh-like output (and more).
