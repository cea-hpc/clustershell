Programming Guide
=================

This part provides programming information for using ClusterShell in
Python applications. It is divided into two sections: node sets handling and
cluster task management, in that order, because managing cluster tasks
requires some knowledge of how to deal with node sets. Each section also
describes the conceptual structures of ClusterShell and provides examples of
how to use them.

This part is intended for intermediate and advanced programmers who are
familiar with Python programming and basic concepts of high-performance
computing (HPC).
