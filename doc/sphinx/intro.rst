Introduction
============

ClusterShell provides a light and unified command execution Python framework
to help administer GNU/Linux or BSD clusters. Some of the most important
benefits of using ClusterShell are to:

* provide an efficient, parallel and highly scalable command execution engine
  in Python,
* support an unified node groups syntax and external group access (see the
  :class:`.NodeSet` class),
* significantly speed up initial cluster setup and daily administrative tasks
  when using tools like :ref:`clush-tool` and :ref:`cluset-tool` /
  :ref:`nodeset-tool`.

Originally created by the HPC Linux system development team at CEA [#]_ HPC
center in France, ClusterShell is designed around medium and long term ideas
of sharing cluster administration development time, and this according to two
axes:

* sharing administrative applications between main components of the computing
  center: compute clusters, but also storage clusters and server farms (so
  they can use the same efficient framework for their administrative
  applications),
* sharing cluster administration techniques across multiple generations of
  super-computing clusters (first of all, to avoid that each cluster
  administration application has to implement its own command execution layer,
  but also to encourage the adoption of event-based coding model in
  cluster management scripts).

Two available coding models make the library well-suited for simple scripts or
for complex applications as well. Also, the library is fully cluster-aware and
has primarily been made for executing remote shell commands in parallel and
gathering output results. But it now also provides the developer a set of
extra features for administrative applications, like file copy support or
time-based notifications (timers) which are discussed in this documentation.
