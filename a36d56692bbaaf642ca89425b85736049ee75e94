I actually did look for examples in the code (because of sthiell\u0027s comment on the github issue) but it\u0027s all over the place at the moment and I can\u0027t see it as actually helping track code that needs to be changed.\n\nI think we\u0027re going to need a python3-pylint anyway so it will probably not make much difference in the long run, but done anyway.",

So this patch doesn\u0027t seem to change behavior much. It just sets the thread a kind of \"autoclose\" flag to address a pretty rare problem. Hopefully that will help.",
