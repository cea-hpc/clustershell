      "message": "Yeah that sounds weird but the problem is when I use cross references, it keeps the section/header name as the link name. Example from the guide: \"If needed group configuration conditions are met (cf. Node groups configuration), you can use the.....\".\n\nI don\u0027t know how to specify a custom link name. I can still change \"clush tool configuration\" to \"clush\" as it is not referenced, but it may be confusing if I change the \"Node groups configuration\" section name as it is referenced a lot.",
